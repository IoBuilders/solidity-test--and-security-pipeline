# solidity-test--and-security-pipeline

This is our current gitlab pipeline based on docker + gitlab-ci. Our vision is to have full coverage and automatically audit code, to be 100% sure that our smart contracts are safe from well known bugs and follow good practices.

### TODO

- Implement a custom gitlab runner to speed up the pipeline execution
